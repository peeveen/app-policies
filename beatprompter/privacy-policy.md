# BeatPrompter Privacy Policy

BeatPrompter does not request or require any unusual permissions to operate.

## Bluetooth

BeatPrompter features Bluetooth functionality to allow multiple devices that are running BeatPrompter to operate
in sync. In older Android versions, this permission is granted automatically, but in newer versions, it must be
granted manually. Please use the **Permissions** settings in the app to grant this permission if you want to use this
functionality.

## Cloud storage

BeatPrompter displays the contents of song files, so you need to connect the app to a source of these files. The
simplest way is using cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive are supported). You will need to perform
a one-time authorization to allow the app to read your files. This authorization generates a "passkey token",
which is an encrypted piece of information that allows this app, _and only this app_, to read your cloud storage
files (no write access is ever requested). This passkey token does not contain your password. BeatPrompter does
not have access to any account passwords, and therefore does not and cannot store any account passwords.

## Local storage

BeatPrompter can use files that you have stored locally on your device. Again, the permission to access these
files must be granted manually, using the **Permissions** settings in the app. However, some very modern versions
of Android will not allow you to grant this permission, in which case you are restricted to using cloud storage
only.

## Further information

- BeatPrompter is friendly software with no hidden agenda.
- BeatPrompter does not "steal" any of your information.
- BeatPrompter does not upload anything to a server ... in fact, there is no server.
- BeatPrompter does not perform any "data mining".
- BeatPrompter does not display any adverts for anything.
- BeatPrompter was created by me, for my own personal use, and I thought other people might find it useful.
